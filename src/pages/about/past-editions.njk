Jadavpur University Model United Nations started its illustrious journey in 2015. Held in the campus itself, the first edition was inaugurated by Chief Guest Mr. Yuri Kolobanov, the Consulate General of the Russian Federation in Kolkata, and simulated three committees - United Nations General Assembly Fourth Committee (Special Political and Decolonisation), the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The three days of committee emphasizing on debate, policy formulations and working papers was a huge success and established Jadavpur University Model United Nations 2019 as the best in India's Eastern MUN circuit. The second edition of JUMUN held in 2016, welcomed 1500 delegates and Executive Board members from India and six other countries and the six committees that made up the conference saw discussions and debates on a number of grave issues including international terrorism and discrimination based on sexual identity. JUMUN 2016 broke the wheel by simulating new committees like the Lok Sabha(which deliberatd upon the land ordinance passed by the Government of India and Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code), the Asian Maritime Organisation for Security and Cooperation, a concept committee which drafted the body's mandate, constitution and voting powers, and the International Press. The third edition of JUMUN held in 2017, was inaugurated by Chief Guest, Mr. Damien Syed, the French Consular General and hosted around 5000 people. The six councils in the third edition discussed Sustainable Development Goals, climate change, combating of sectarian violence in Islam, the use of force regime and need for comprehensive healthcare policy in India.

The fourth edition of JUMUN held in 2018 had a number of diverse committees including a Fifth World Conference on Women, a Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the flagship committee which was Department for Exiting the European Union, Lok Sabha, International Press, General Assembly on Disarmament and International Security and the Security Council. JUMUN 2018 also believed in expanding the work of our industrious team beyond the committee rooms in order to address the real issues plaguing our society and therefore, we launched the Civil Society Initiative, under which we had campaigns like Pot a Plant, free education to underprivileged children at different NGOs, books and clothes donation drive and a sanitary pad drive. To aid us in our mission, we also started the JUMUN Juniors' Initiative, which was about including school students in the process of organizing an MUN and in turn, helping them, by grooming them through free workshops and providing exclusive research material. We are proud to announce that as collaborators we had Responsible Charity, Panacea, the UN Information Centre in Bhutan and the West Bengal Federation of United Nations Association. Our aim has always been generating awareness about international laws, human rights and challenges faced by the world and by hosting this three day conference, we wish to contribute as a part of the global community and make the world a better place. In the process of organizing the past four editions, we have worked hard with the hope that our efforts are channelized in the right direction and our dedication can contribute to making a difference. This year we shall work harder to achieve the same
